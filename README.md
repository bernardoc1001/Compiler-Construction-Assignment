This is my solution for the combined first and second assignments for Compiler Construction.

The aim of the first assignment is to implement a lexical and syntax analyser using JavaCC for a simple language called CCAL.

The aim of the second assignment is to add semantic analysis checks and intermediate representation generation to the lexical and syntax analyser I have implemented in Assignment 1. The generated intermediate code should be a 3-address code and stored in a file with the ".ir" extension.
